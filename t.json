In their last encounter, a kiss from the deadly villainess left a post hypnotic suggestion in the Batman's mind. Now every woman he sees is Poison Ivy. Every word they say is spoken in her honeyed, seductive whisper. Always Poison Ivy re-enforces the notion that Batman is under her spell, and will be unable to resist the urge to break her free from Gotham State Penitentiary. Dick Grayson notices Wayne's distance, but fails to shake Wayne from his reverie. Gunshots, however, do the trick. Quickly donning their costumes, Batman and Robin swing into action. The Dynamic Duo break up a gang of crooks attempting to execute several key witnesses in the court case against Joe \"The Undertaker.\" Crime fighting seems to break Poison Ivy's sway over Batman. Feigning repentance, Poison Ivy crafts a pocket mirror, in the prison's machine shop, and has it delivered to Batman, along with a letter. The pocket mirror seems to more strongly place the Batman under Poison Ivy's spell, as the Caped Crusader literally spends days staring into the mirror. Always seeing her face in the looking glass, and hearing her voice, urging him to release her from prison. In an attempt to clear Batman's head, Robin takes the Dark Knight on a ferry ride across Gotham River. Criminals hijack the ferry. Batman focuses on the mirror, leaving Robin to take the crooks on alone. Only after seeing the Boy Wonder take a terrible beating does Batman intervene, quickly making short work of the hijackers.</p><p>Batman shatters the mirror, then sends the pieces back to Poison Ivy. Days later, Batman is summoned to the prison hospital, where Poison Ivy has taken deathly ill. Poison Ivy requests one last kiss. As Batman is overwhelmed with compassion, Poison Ivy uses his momentary weakness to take Batman hostage, with her hair. Holding a clump of her explosive-laden hair, Poison Ivy forces Batman to carry her out of the prison infirmary, to a waiting getaway car, outside the penitentiary walls. The prison's guards' pursuit is foiled when Poison Ivy hurls the strands of her hair at their vehicles. The hairs explode underneath the three cars, disabling them. Batman grabs the steering wheel to take control of the getaway car, only to find his hand pricked by a drugged needle, mounted on the wheel. Batman passes out. Batman awakens to find a leash around his neck, with Poison Ivy holding the other end. To protest his captivity, Batman begins a hunger strike. After several days, Poison Ivy decides to force feed Batman, intravenously. Setting up the I.V. panics Poison Ivy's pet panther, forcing Batman to come to her rescue, when the spooked wild cat lunges for her. Poison Ivy pulls Batman in close for a kiss, just as Robin bursts in. The Boy Wonder takes down Poison Ivy's gang. Poison Ivy pulls back from the kiss to find that Batman has bound her wrists with the I.V.'s rubber tubing. Poison Ivy is returned to prison, still certain that Batman, under her spell, will eventually free her.</p><h3>Batman's Baffling Turnabout!</h3><p>Batman and Robin bust a criminal gang at an import/export warehouse, in Gotham City. In pursuit of the last crook, Batman triggers a trap door, plummeting down onto an adhesive coated net, suspended over Gotham River. From above, a mysterious figure tells Batman that the entire warehouse had been set with traps. Having served a five year prison sentence, the mystery criminal set a revenge plan in motion to get back at the Batman. With the tide coming in, Gotham River begins to rise. Soon Batman will be engulfed. The mystery man leaves Batman to drown. Donning a Batman costume, the mystery crook joins Robin, feigning a sprained ankle. Though Robin immediately realizes that this man is not the Batman, he plays along with the deception. Driving the Batmobile, Robin takes the injured \"Batman\" to an auxiliary Batcave. Robin suggests they relax and unmask, then fakes a call from the hotline,to keep from revealing his own identity, \"Batman' defers the emergency to Robin, citing his injury. Robin drives off, but spies on the \"Batman\", from a monitor in the Batmobile. Interference on the monitor screen prompts Robin to check under the hood of the Batmobile, where he finds an explosive device. The same kind of explosive device he watched the \"Batman\" plant in the Batcave. Robin disarms the device, then waits for the \"Batman\" to depart, before returning to the Batcave to disarm the second explosive. Robin sets off the explosives to maintain the illusion that the \"Batman's\" scheme has succeeded. Robin discreetly follows the \"Batman\" back to the warehouse. When the \"Batman\" opens the trap door to inspect Batman's corpse, the Caped Crusader springs out. The two men battle for several moments, each smashing pottery and statuary against the other. The real Batman triumphs, just as Robin arrives. Batman escaped the death trap by knocking his laser torch loose from his utility belt, then waiting for it it rise up with the river, until it was within reach. After that, it was a simple matter to cut himself loose from the net. Robin, for his part, was able to instantly see through the \"Batman's\" deception due to the fact that the criminal's costume was out of date, and thus did not reflect the alterations Batman had made to his uniform, in the five years the other man had been incarcerated.</p>","hasStaffReview":false,"id":8751,"image":{"iconUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/7925-796-8751-1-batman.jpg","mediumUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/7925-796-8751-1-batman.jpg","screenUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/7925-796-8751-1-batman.jpg","screenLargeUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/7925-796-8751-1-batman.jpg","smallUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/7925-796-8751-1-batman.jpg","superUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/7925-796-8751-1-batman.jpg","thumbUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/7925-796-8751-1-batman.jpg","tinyUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/7925-796-8751-1-batman.jpg","originalUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/7925-796-8751-1-batman.jpg","imageTags":"All Images"},"associatedImages":[],"issueNumber":"183","name":"A Touch of Poison Ivy!; Batman's Baffling Turnabout!","siteDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman-183-a-touch-of-poison-ivy-batmans-baffling-/4000-8751/","storeDate":null,"volume":{"apiDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-796/","id":796,"name":"Batman","siteDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman/4050-796/"}},{"aliases":null,"apiDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-8976/","coverDate":"1966-12-01","dateAdded":"2008-06-06 11:09:13","dateLastUpdated":"2021-08-03 14:49:46","deck":null,"description":"<p><em>The sudden appearance of a new criminal basing his crimes on time jogs Batman’s memory into remembering that this criminal was his very first case after his parents were killed, and if the Clock has his way, the current case against him will be the Caped Crusader’s last!</em></p><h3>Batman's First Case</h3><p>The famed crime-crusader is threatened with death by o vill ion whom he first encountered at the start of his career!</p><h3>Phantom Eye of Gotham City</h3><p>Twin Troubles face the Dynamic Duo as an uncanny Eye probes the secret Bat-Cave, and a Batman impostor boldly challenges the great lawman!</p><h3>Last Days of Batman</h3><p>Fate had given Robin a brief glimpse of a day in the near future - when the newspaper headlines announced Batman's death!</p><h3>Peril at Playland Isle</h3><p>An amusement park, ironically, is the setting for a murder mystery and a manhunt - with the Dynamic Duo in a grim battle against a desperate killer!</p><h3>Batman of Tomorrow</h3><p>Out of the future comes a Batman of the year 3055 to take the place of the injured Batman of today!</p><h3>Ballad of Batman</h3><p>A wandering minstrel composes a song about the great heroes of Gotham City, little dreaming of the dangerous effects of one of his verses!</p>","hasStaffReview":false,"id":8976,"image":{"iconUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/8126-796-8976-1-batman.jpg","mediumUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/8126-796-8976-1-batman.jpg","screenUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/8126-796-8976-1-batman.jpg","screenLargeUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/8126-796-8976-1-batman.jpg","smallUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/8126-796-8976-1-batman.jpg","superUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/8126-796-8976-1-batman.jpg","thumbUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/8126-796-8976-1-batman.jpg","tinyUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/8126-796-8976-1-batman.jpg","originalUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/8126-796-8976-1-batman.jpg","imageTags":"All Images"},"associatedImages":[],"issueNumber":"187","name":"Batman's First Case","siteDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman-187-batmans-first-case/4000-8976/","storeDate":null,"volume":{"apiDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-796/","id":796,"name":"Batman","siteDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman/4050-796/"}},{"aliases":null,"apiDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-9034/","coverDate":"1966-12-31","dateAdded":"2008-06-06 11:09:13","dateLastUpdated":"2020-08-18 14:54:52","deck":null,"description":"<p><em>Commissioner Gordon gets Batman to investigate a series of crimes in which all of the clues have been erased, and the Caped Crusader goes undercover to do so.</em></p><h3><em>The Eraser Who Tried to Rub Out Batman!</em></h3><p>Standing outside a department store window display, Bruce Wayne is captivated by a giant eraser. Wayne is reminded of an old college classmate, one Lenny Fiasco. Prone to making mistakes at the black board, Wayne can only recall a single time he ever saw Fiasco without an eraser in his hands, at a winter carnival. Fiasco, tears brimming in his eyes, watched Wayne ride by with the \"Ice Queen\", a fellow classmate, and Fiasco's secret crush. Returning to Wayne Manor, Wayne is informed that the police commissioner has been desperately trying to contact Wayne, or rather, his alter-ego, Batman. Wayne, along with his youthful ward, Dick Grayson, as Batman and Robin, journey to the Riverside Bank, and a rendezvous with Commissioner Gordon. The bank robbery is but the latest in a string of crimes that has baffled Gordon. Somehow, the perpetrators have managed to commit these robberies without leaving a single bit of evidence behind. The Batman conducts his own investigation of the crime scene, but can also turn up no clues. Stepping outside for some air, the caped crusader is mobbed by a group of autograph seeking groupies, all but one of whom completely ignore his sidekick, Robin. Suddenly, a model of Batman crashes at his feet. Believing it to be a distress signal, the dynamic duo scales the building wall, to the window the model fell from, and discover a charity auction in the midst of being robbed by masked gunmen. Batman and Robin quickly subdue the would-be robbers. A quick search of the men produces a newspaper that ignites at the Batman's touch. The paper turns out to be a copy of \"The Secret Underground\", a criminal publication that offers tips on committing crimes. Of particular interest is an advertisement from a man called \"The Eraser\", who offers to eliminate any and all crime scene evidence, for a mere 20% of the profits. Batman and Robin go undercover to flush the Eraser out into the open.</p><p>Batman's cover identity is that of an organ grinder, with Robin cast in the role of the monkey. With the co-operation of the Gotham City Police Department, Batman, as the organ grinder, burglarizes a jewelry store. Robin is left behind to serve as back-up, in case Batman runs into trouble. In the process of robbing the store's safe, the \"organ grinder\" is startled by the sudden presence of the Eraser. The bizarre villain removes his helmet and begins erasing all the evidence the \"organ grinder\" has left in the commission of this crime. Batman is stunned to see that the face behind the Eraser's helmet is that of Lenny Fiasco, his old college classmate. Unfortunately, Fiasco also recognizes the \"organ grinder\" as Bruce Wayne, by the signature scent of his shaving lotion. Fiasco confesses his love, to Wayne, for Celia Smith, The Ice Queen of the Winter Carnival. When Wayne \"took\" her from Fiasco, the brokenhearted collegian left the academic life behind for a life of crime. Now, the class joke who was always erasing his own mistakes, is cleaning up by erasing the mistakes of Gotham City's criminal element. Wayne pleads with Fiasco to reconsider the path he's chosen, but Fiasco gasses Wayne into unconsciousness, and carries his hated rival to his secret hideout. Fiasco has engineered an exact recreation of the Winter Carnival, complete with life sized figures of Wayne and Smith, carved from ice. Wayne is placed inside his own figurine and left to slowly freeze to death. Wayne uses his escape artist skills to free himself from his icy coffin. The Boy Wonder arrives, providing Wayne with the necessary distraction to switch to Batman. The Dynamic Duo uses Fiasco's ice sculptures as cover, as they close with the Eraser, and his gunsels. In short order, the villains are put down. In prison, Batman and Robin gift Fiasco with the giant eraser, from the department store window. By the time Fiasco erases the mistakes of his life, his sentence will be ended.</p><h3><em>The Ten Best-Dressed Corpses in Gotham City!</em></h3><p>In the office of Police Commissioner Gordon, Batman and Robin meet with Matt Whitson, the publisher of the magazine, Squire. Every year, Squire releases a \"Ten Best-Dressed Men of Gotham City\" list. Prior to the release of this year's publication, the first three men on the list, Charles Lowry, Deems Davis, &amp; Terrence Green, have all died. All within the last week. The next name on the list is that of Batman's alter-ego, Bruce Wayne. As they exit the police precinct, Batman tells Robin that, just that morning, he was nearly killed, as Wayne, when he suddenly lost control of his car and drove off into a ravine. With the killer believing that Wayne has perished, Batman and Robin rush to inform the fifth man, Hampden Dennis, of his peril. Dennis brushes off the potential danger, and goes about his business. Batman and Robin tail Dennis to a seedy area of Gotham City. When Dennis' chauffeur enters a building through the basement entrance, then emerges carrying a metal box, Batman reveals his presence. Dennis and the chauffeur attack Batman and Robin, but are quickly defeated. At police headquarters, Dennis is revealed to be the secret king of Gotham City's numbers rackets. While his arrest is a real coup for Commissioner Gordon, it doesn't bring Batman any closer to catching the killer.</p><p>As Dennis' arrest has only just occurred, Batman reasons that the killer would have no way of knowing that Dennis is safe and sound in the Gotham City jail. Batman and Robin travel to Dennis' home, in the hopes of catching the killer. The Dynamic Duo split up to search the house. When Robin enters the sauna, the door locks behind him, and the room begins filling with scalding hot steam. Robin radios Batman for immediate assistance. As Batman races to the sauna to rescue the Boy Wonder, he is ambushed by the killer. Though the killer has gotten the drop on Batman, the Caped Crusader manages to dodge the killer's bullet, before beating the man down. Once Robin has been released from the trap meant for Dennis, Batman attends to the killer, Matt Whitson. During the Korean War, Whitson had been taken prisoner and, in an act of cowardice, betrayed his countrymen. It had been Whitson's secret for years, until Deems Davis, the author, uncovered the truth while researching for a book about the war. Deems opted to blackmail Whitson, prompting Whitson to kill Deems. By blind chance, Charles Lowry, the architect, perished in a genuine accident, earlier that same week. Lowry's death inspired Whitson to begin staging accidents for the other men on the list, in the hopes of leading the police astray in their investigation of Deems' death. Unfortunately for Whitson, while he may have outfoxed the police, he was no match for Batman.</p>","hasStaffReview":false,"id":9034,"image":{"iconUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/8182-796-9034-1-batman.jpg","mediumUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/8182-796-9034-1-batman.jpg","screenUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/8182-796-9034-1-batman.jpg","screenLargeUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/8182-796-9034-1-batman.jpg","smallUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/8182-796-9034-1-batman.jpg","superUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/8182-796-9034-1-batman.jpg","thumbUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/8182-796-9034-1-batman.jpg","tinyUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/8182-796-9034-1-batman.jpg","originalUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/8182-796-9034-1-batman.jpg","imageTags":"All Images"},"associatedImages":[],"issueNumber":"188","name":"The Eraser Who Tried to Rub Out Batman; The Ten Best-Dressed Corpses in Gotham City","siteDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman-188-the-eraser-who-tried-to-rub-out-batman-/4000-9034/","storeDate":"1966-10-20","volume":{"apiDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-796/","id":796,"name":"Batman","siteDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman/4050-796/"}},{"aliases":null,"apiDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-9325/","coverDate":"1967-05-01","dateAdded":"2008-06-06 11:09:13","dateLastUpdated":"2020-09-01 22:49:03","deck":null,"description":"<p><em>When Ira Radon absorbs so much radiation that he is forced to give up his life of crime, he decides to get revenge by dousing Batman’s equipment with deadly radiation, forcing the Caped Crusader to give up his career.</em></p><p><strong>\"The Day Batman Sold Out!\"</strong></p><p><a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> has tracked down Ira Radon, a criminal who is responsible for stealing radioactive isotopes all over <a href=\"/gotham-city/4020-23611/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City</a>.

The Dynamic Duo are stunned to discover that Catwoman has captured the Parker Brothers, the very criminals they themselves were looking to catch. Robin is suspicious of Catwoman's reform. Batman, too, is dubious, pointing out that the Gotham Winery distills it's wine from <em>cat</em>awba grapes. The following night, the Caped Crusaders bust up a theft ring at a silk factory. Suspecting trouble, a portion of the gang hid, laying in wait to ambush any lawmen who came along. Taken by surprise, Batman is momentarily overwhelmed. Robin's timely assistance returns the advantage to Batman.</p><p>The Dark Knight returns the favor when Robin, too, finds himself suddenly overwhelmed. Though they fight valiantly against the criminals' larger numbers, the Dynamic Duo soon find themselves up against a wall, staring down the barrels of a half dozen revolvers. Suddenly, Catwoman's cat-o-nine-tails snaps across the criminals' heads, detonating tiny explosives near their ears. With Catwoman's aid, the Caped Crusaders, finally, put the criminal gang down. Though Batman can see no \"cat\" themed angle in this robbery, Barbara Gordon makes the connection. A specific type of silk bandana, or handkerchief, is also know as a puli<em>cat</em>. Gordon intuits that Catwoman's next outing will occur at the Gotham Wax Museum, where the <em>cat</em>afalque of a wealthy maharajah is on display. Gordon changes into her Batgirl costume, and journeys to the museum.</p><p>Sure enough, Catwoman is already there, in the midst of thwarting another gang of thieves. Batgirl throws herself at the crooks. Clumsily, Batgirl engages the crooks in combat. A fatal miscalculation in Batgirl's attack strategy leaves her stunned, and reeling on the floor. Only then does Catwoman intervene, quickly taking out the gang of crooks. Egged on by Catwoman, Batgirl shamefully admits to her shortcomings, in front of Batman, then silently walks away. In the days that follow, Catwoman takes Gotham City by storm. Her fame skyrockets, and legions of fans mob her wherever she goes. At night, Catwoman continues to bring in criminal gang after criminal gang. Feeling she's proved herself a more capable partner for Batman than Batgirl, Catwoman offers herself as Batman's partner... and wife. Quite comfortable with the status quo, Batman declines.</p><p>In the Batcave, Batman finally acknowledges what the whole of Gotham City already knows, Catwoman is in love with him. Fearing that matters will soon come to a head between them, Batman decides to take certain precautions before going on patrol. Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Catwoman all simultaneously converge on the Coin Chateau. A group of thieves is already inside, helping themselves to the Duke of Apulia's collection of rare silver du<em>cat</em>s. Catwoman is surprised to see Batgirl back in action. Batgirl, though, has figured out that Catwoman used <em>cat</em>optrics in their last encounter. By swinging a bauble about, Catwoman distorted the light in the room enough to affect Batgirl's vision, and throw off her combat timing. Knowing that Batgirl is on to her, Catwoman suddenly turns, and clubs Batman into unconsciousness.</p><p>The thieves, really Catwoman's gang, quickly overwhelm Batgirl and Robin. Catwoman unmasks Batman, only to discover that Batman has painted his face, underneath his mask. Batgirl and Robin are revealed to have done the same. Removing their utility belts, Catwoman has the three crimefighters placed in a preprepared trap. Catwoman reveals that she only reformed in return for a wedding proposal from Batman. Catwoman issues Batman her final ultimatum, marry her or she will return to her life of crime. Batman rushes Catwoman, only to be repelled by a sonic barrier. Catwoman's <em>cat</em>aphonic trap amplifies the prerecorded snarls of cats into an invisible cat's cradle of sound waves. The pain of contact is excruciating. Nonetheless, Batman refuses to marry Catwoman. The Feline Felon robs a high stakes poker game, taking full possession of the \"kitty\".</p><p>Catwoman returns to gloat, holding Batman responsible for her actions, by refusing to marry her. Suddenly, Batgirl leaps clear of the cataphonic trap. Before Catwoman can use her catoptrics against her, Batgirl beats Catwoman into submission. Batman and Robin step forward to take down Catwoman's gang. Batgirl reveals that she hypnotized Batman. Gently swinging her gloves against the sound barrier, Batgirl created a somnambulant tone that put Batman into a trance. With his pain receptors clouded under hypnosis, Batman was able to walk through the cataphonic field and turn it off. Catwoman also learns that all her efforts to make Batgirl look bad were pointless. Batgirl never had any romantic notions towards Batman, and thus was never the rival Catwoman believed her to be.</p>","hasStaffReview":false,"id":9784,"image":{"iconUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/4/8861-796-9784-1-batman.jpg","mediumUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/4/8861-796-9784-1-batman.jpg","screenUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/4/8861-796-9784-1-batman.jpg","screenLargeUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/4/8861-796-9784-1-batman.jpg","smallUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4/8861-796-9784-1-batman.jpg","superUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/4/8861-796-9784-1-batman.jpg","thumbUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/8861-796-9784-1-batman.jpg","tinyUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/4/8861-796-9784-1-batman.jpg","originalUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/8861-796-9784-1-batman.jpg","imageTags":"All Images"},"associatedImages":[],"issueNumber":"197","name":"The Catwoman Sets Her Claws for Batman","siteDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman-197-the-catwoman-sets-her-claws-for-batman/4000-9784/","storeDate":null,"volume":{"apiDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/volume/4050-796/","id":796,"name":"Batman","siteDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/batman/4050-796/"}},{"aliases":null,"apiDetailUrl":"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-9911/","coverDate":"1968-02-01","dateAdded":"2008-06-06 11:09:13","dateLastUpdated":"2022-07-12 03:51:26","deck":null,"description":"<p>This is a collection of reprints none of which are newer then 1960, According to the editor's note it was also the first time the Batman series listed a table of contents and description of reprints for their \"Giant-sized\" readers.
